        <title>A wonderful journey has begun</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our website. This website, I hope will be a new chapter for our clan. We started this journey almost a year ago. Since then, our clan has grown up. We have had our fair share of problems, yet we are here, almost intact. Almost, because we have lost a few members (though I hope to get them back). Eventually, this website will serve as a clan details page and recruitment platform (if it ever comes to that). Meanwhile, we have wars to win and fun to be had. Semper fi.&lt;/p&gt;
